By Adrian Lapico >>> Adroso360

This is a game designed by to help players learn about the properties
and uses of economically-significant and common rock-forming minerals.

The deck consists of 54 mineral cards and 6 “supertrump” cards.

Each mineral card includes information about the mineral such as the generic chemical formula,
the classification, crystal system, the geological environment where the mineral is
commonly found or formed (igneous, metamorphic, sedimentary, or the mantle), as well as information in the
five playing categories (or trumps) of Hardness, Specific Gravity, Cleavage, Crustal Abundance, and Economic Value.
The first three trump categories relate to distinct physical properties of the mineral,
while last two categories rate the importance of the mineral in terms of abundance in the
Earths crust (continental and oceanic) and value to modern societies.

Number of players: 3 to 5
